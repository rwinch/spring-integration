You can detect this by using the `check-length` attribute..

| `check-length`
| `true`, `false`
| Whether a UDP adapter expects a data length field in the packet received.
Used to detect packet truncation.

| `so-timeout`
|
| See the `setSoTimeout()` methods in `java.net.DatagramSocket` for more information.

| `so-send-buffer-size`
|
| Used for UDP acknowledgment packets.
See the setSendBufferSize() methods in `java.net.DatagramSocket` for more information.

| `so-receive-buffer-size`

| If a downstream component throws an exception, the `MessagingException` message that contains the exception and failed message is sent to this channel.

| `lookup-host`
| `true`, `false`
| Specifies whether reverse lookups are done on IP addresses to convert to host names for use in message headers.
If `false`, the IP address is used instead.
Default: `false`.

The following table describes attributes that you can set to configure UDP outbound channel adapters:

.UDP Outbound Channel Adapter Attributes
[cols="2,^1,4", options="header"]
|===
| Attribute Name
| Allowed Values
| Attribute Description

| `host`
|
| The host name or ip address of the destination.
For multicast udp adapters, the multicast address.

| `port`
|
| The port on the destination.

| `multicast`
| `true`, `false`
| Whether or not the udp adapter uses multicast.

| `acknowledge`
| `true`, `false`
| Whether a UDP adapter requires an acknowledgment from the destination.
When enabled, it requires setting the following four attributes: `ack-host`, `ack-port`, `ack-timeout`, and `min-acks-for- success`.

| `ack-host`
|
| When `acknowledge` is `true`, indicates the host or IP address to which the acknowledgment should be sent.
Usually the current host, but may be different -- for example, when Network Address Translation (NAT) is being used.

| `ack-port`
|
| When `acknowledge` is `true`, indicates the port to which the acknowledgment should be sent.
The adapter listens on this port for acknowledgments.

| `ack-timeout`
|
| When `acknowledge` is `true`, indicates the time in milliseconds that the adapter waits for an acknowledgment.
If an acknowledgment is not received in time, the adapter throws an exception.

| `min-acks-for- success`
|
| Defaults to 1.
For multicast adapters, you can set this to a larger value, which requires acknowledgments from multiple destinations.

| `check-length`
| `true`, `false`
| Whether or not a UDP adapter includes a data length field in the packet sent to the destination.

| `time-to-live`
|
| For multicast adapters, specifies the time-to-live attribute for the `MulticastSocket`.
Controls the scope of the multicasts.
Refer to the Java API documentation for more information.

| `so-timeout`
|
| See `java.net.DatagramSocket` setSoTimeout() methods for more information.

| `so-send-buffer-size`
|
| See the `setSendBufferSize()` methods in `java.net.DatagramSocket` for more information.

| `so-receive-buffer-size`
|
| Used for UDP acknowledgment packets.
See the `setReceiveBufferSize()` methods in `java.net.DatagramSocket` for more information.
| local-address
|
| On a multi-homed system, for the UDP adapter, specifies an IP address for the interface to which the socket is bound for reply messages.
For a multicast adapter, it also determines which interface the multicast packets are sent over.

| `task-executor`
|
| Specifies a specific executor to be used for acknowledgment handling.
If not supplied, an internal single threaded executor is used.
Needed on some platforms that require the use of specific task executors, such as a `WorkManagerTaskExecutor`.
One thread is dedicated to handling acknowledgments (if the `acknowledge` option is true).

| `destination-expression`
| SpEL expression
| A SpEL expression to be evaluated to determine which `SocketAddress` to use as a destination address for the outgoing UDP packets.

| `socket-expression`
| SpEL expression
| A SpEL expression to be evaluated to determine which datagram socket use for sending outgoing UDP packets.
