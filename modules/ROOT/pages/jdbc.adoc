= JDBC Support

Spring Integration provides channel adapters for receiving and sending messages by using database queries.
Through those adapters, Spring Integration supports not only plain JDBC SQL queries but also stored procedure and stored function calls.

You need to include this dependency into your project:

====
[source, xml, subs="normal", role="primary"]
.Maven
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.integration</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-integration-jdbc</artifactId>
    <version>{project-version}</version>
</dependency>
----
[source, groovy, subs="normal", role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
compile "org.springframework.integration:spring-integration-jdbc:{project-version}"
----
====

By default, the following JDBC components are available:

* <<jdbc-inbound-channel-adapter,Inbound Channel Adapter>>
* <<jdbc-outbound-channel-adapter,Outbound Channel Adapter>>
* <<jdbc-outbound-gateway,Outbound Gateway>>
* <<stored-procedure-inbound-channel-adapter,Stored Procedure Inbound Channel Adapter>>
* <<stored-procedure-outbound-channel-adapter,Stored Procedure Outbound Channel Adapter>>
* <<stored-procedure-outbound-gateway,Stored Procedure Outbound Gateway>>

The Spring Integration JDBC Module also provides a <<jdbc-message-store,JDBC Message Store>>.
