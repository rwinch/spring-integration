[[jdbc-outbound-gateway]]
= Outbound Gateway

The outbound gateway is like a combination of the outbound and inbound adapters: Its role is to handle a message and use it to execute a SQL query and then respond with the result by sending it to a reply channel.
By default, the message payload and headers are available as input parameters to the query, as the following example shows:

====
[source,xml]
----
<int-jdbc:outbound-gateway
    update="insert into mythings (id, status, name) values (:headers[id], 0, :payload[thing])"
    request-channel="input" reply-channel="output" data-source="dataSource" />
----
====

The result of the preceding example is to insert a record into the `mythings` table and return a message that indicates the number of rows affected (the payload is a map: `{UPDATED=1}`) to the output channel .

If the update query is an insert with auto-generated keys, you can populate the reply message with the generated keys by adding `keys-generated="true"` to the preceding example (this is not the default because it is not supported by some database platforms).
The following example shows the changed configuration:

====
[source,xml]
----
<int-jdbc:outbound-gateway
    update="insert into mythings (status, name) values (0, :payload[thing])"
    request-channel="input" reply-channel="output" data-source="dataSource"
    keys-generated="true"/>
----
====

Instead of the update count or the generated keys, you can also provide a select query to execute and generate a reply message from the result (such as the inbound adapter), as the following example shows:

====
[source,xml]
----
<int-jdbc:outbound-gateway
    update="insert into foos (id, status, name) values (:headers[id], 0, :payload[foo])"
    query="select * from foos where id=:headers[$id]"
    request-channel="input" reply-channel="output" data-source="dataSource"/>
----
====

Since Spring Integration 2.2, the update SQL query is no longer mandatory.
You can now provide only a select query, by using either the `query` attribute or the `query` element.
This is extremely useful if you need to actively retrieve data by using, for example, a generic gateway or a payload enricher.
The reply message is then generated from the result (similar to how the inbound adapter works) and passed to the reply channel.
The following example show to use the `query` attribute:

====
[source,xml]
----
<int-jdbc:outbound-gateway
    query="select * from foos where id=:headers[id]"
    request-channel="input"
    reply-channel="output"
    data-source="dataSource"/>
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
By default, the component for the `SELECT` query returns only one (the first) row from the cursor.
You can adjust this behavior with the `max-rows` option.
If you need to return all the rows from the SELECT, consider specifying `max-rows="0"`.
====

As with the channel adapters, you can also provide `SqlParameterSourceFactory` instances for request and reply.
The default is the same as for the outbound adapter, so the request message is available as the root of an expression.
If `keys-generated="true"`, the root of the expression is the generated keys (a map if there is only one or a list of maps if multi-valued).

The outbound gateway requires a reference to either a `DataSource` or a `JdbcTemplate`.
It can also have a `SqlParameterSourceFactory` injected to control the binding of the incoming message to the query.

Starting with the version 4.2, the `request-prepared-statement-setter` attribute is available on the `<int-jdbc:outbound-gateway>` as an alternative to `request-sql-parameter-source-factory`.
It lets you specify a `MessagePreparedStatementSetter` bean reference, which implements more sophisticated `PreparedStatement` preparation before its execution.

Starting with the version 6.0, the `JdbcOutboundGateway` returns an empty list result as is instead of converting it to `null` as it was before with the meaning "no reply".
This caused an extra configuration in applications where handling of empty lists is a part of downstream logic.
See xref:splitter.adoc#split-stream-and-flux[Splitter Discard Channel] for possible empty list handling option.

See xref:jdbc/outbound-channel-adapter.adoc[Outbound Channel Adapter] for more information about `MessagePreparedStatementSetter`.
