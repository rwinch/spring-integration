= AMQP Samples

To experiment with the AMQP adapters, check out the samples available in the Spring Integration samples git repository at https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration-samples[https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-integration-samples]

Currently, one sample demonstrates the basic functionality of the Spring Integration AMQP adapter by using an outbound channel adapter and an inbound channel adapter.
As AMQP broker implementation in the sample uses https://www.rabbitmq.com/[RabbitMQ].

NOTE: In order to run the example, you need a running instance of RabbitMQ.
A local installation with just the basic defaults suffices.
For detailed RabbitMQ installation procedures, see https://www.rabbitmq.com/install.html[https://www.rabbitmq.com/install.html]

Once the sample application is started, enter some text on the command prompt and a message containing that entered text is dispatched to the AMQP queue.
In return, that message is retrieved by Spring Integration and printed to the console.

The following image illustrates the basic set of Spring Integration components used in this sample:
