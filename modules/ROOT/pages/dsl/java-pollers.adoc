Spring Integration also provides a fluent API that lets you configure `PollerMetadata` for `AbstractPollingEndpoint` implementations.
You can use the `Pollers` builder factory to configure common bean definitions or those created from `IntegrationFlowBuilder` EIP methods, as the following example shows:

[source,java]
----
@Bean(name = PollerMetadata.DEFAULT_POLLER)
public PollerSpec poller() {
    return Pollers.fixedRate(500)
        .errorChannel("myErrors");
}
----

See https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/dsl/Pollers.html[`Pollers`] and https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/dsl/PollerSpec.html[`PollerSpec`] in the Javadoc for more information.

IMPORTANT: If you use the DSL to construct a `PollerSpec` as a `@Bean`, do not call the `getObject()` method in the bean definition.
The `PollerSpec` is a `FactoryBean` that generates the `PollerMetadata` object from the specification and initializes all of its properties.
