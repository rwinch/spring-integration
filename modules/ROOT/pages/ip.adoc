[[ip]]
= TCP and UDP Support

Spring Integration provides channel adapters for receiving and sending messages over internet protocols.
Both UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) adapters are provided.
Each adapter provides for one-way communication over the underlying protocol.
In addition, Spring Integration provides simple inbound and outbound TCP gateways.
These are used when two-way communication is needed.
