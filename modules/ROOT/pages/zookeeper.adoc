[[zookeeper]]
== Zookeeper Support

Version 4.2 added https://zookeeper.apache.org/[Zookeeper] support to the framework in version 4.2, which consists of:

* <<zk-metadata-store,A metadata store>>
* <<zk-lock-registry,A lock registry>>
* <<zk-leadership,Leadership event handling>>

You need to include this dependency into your project:

====
[source, xml, subs="normal", role="primary"]
.Maven
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.integration</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-integration-zookeeper</artifactId>
    <version>{project-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

[source, groovy, subs="normal", role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
compile "org.springframework.integration:spring-integration-zookeeper:{project-version}"
----

[[zk-metadata-store]]
=== Zookeeper Metadata Store

You ca use the `ZookeeperMetadataStore` where any `MetadataStore` is needed, such as for persistent file list filters.
See <<./meta-data-store.adoc#metadata-store,Metadata Store>> for more information.
The following example configures a Zookeeper metadata store with XML:

====
[source, xml]
----
<bean id="client" class="org.springframework.integration.zookeeper.config.CuratorFrameworkFactoryBean">
    <constructor-arg value="${connect.string}" />
</bean>

<bean id="meta" class="org.springframework.integration.zookeeper.metadata.ZookeeperMetadataStore">
    <constructor-arg ref="client" />
</bean>
----
====

The following example shows how to configure a Zookeeper metadata store with Java:

====
[source, java]
----
@Bean
public MetadataStore zkStore(CuratorFramework client) {
    return new ZookeeperMetadataStore(client);
}
----
====

[[zk-lock-registry]]
=== Zookeeper Lock Registry

The `ZookeeperLockRegistry` can be used where any `LockRegistry` is needed, such as when using an aggregator in a clustered environment with a shared `MessageStore`.

A `LockRegistry` is used to "`look up`" a lock based on a key (the aggregator uses `correlationId`).
By default, locks in the `ZookeeperLockRegistry` are maintained in zookeeper under the following path: `/SpringIntegration-LockRegistry/`.
You can customize the path by providing an implementation of `ZookeeperLockRegistry.KeyToPathStrategy`, as the following example shows:

====
[source, java]
----
public interface KeyToPathStrategy {

    String pathFor(String key);

    boolean bounded();

}
----
====

If the strategy returns `true` from `isBounded`, unused locks do not need to be harvested.
For unbounded strategies (such as the default), you need to periodically invoke `expireUnusedOlderThan(long age)` to remove old unused locks from memory.

String with version 5.5.6, the `ZookeeperLockRegistry` is support automatically clean up cache for ZkLock in `ZookeeperLockRegistry.locks` via `ZookeeperLockRegistry.setCacheCapacity()`.
See its JavaDocs for more information.

[[zk-leadership]]
=== Zookeeper Leadership Event Handling

The following example uses XML to configure an application for leader election in Zookeeper:

====
[source, xml]
----
<int-zk:leader-listener client="client" path="/siNamespace" role="cluster" />
----
====

`client` is a reference to a `CuratorFramework` bean.
A `CuratorFrameworkFactoryBean` is available.
When a leader is elected, an `OnGrantedEvent` is published for the role `cluster`.
Any endpoints in that role are started.
When leadership is revoked, an `OnRevokedEvent` is published for the role `cluster`.
Any endpoints in that role are stopped.
See <<./endpoint.adoc#endpoint-roles,Endpoint Roles>> for more information.

You can use Java configuration to create an instance of the leader initiator, as the following example shows:

====
[source, java]
----
@Bean
public LeaderInitiatorFactoryBean leaderInitiator(CuratorFramework client) {
    return new LeaderInitiatorFactoryBean()
                .setClient(client)
                .setPath("/siTest/")
                .setRole("cluster");
}
----
====

Starting with version 5.3, a `candidate` option is exposed on the `LeaderInitiatorFactoryBean` for more configuration control of the externally provided `Candidate` instance.
Only one of the `candidate` or `role` options has to be provided, but not both; the `role` options creates internally a `DefaultCandidate` instance with an `UUID` for `id` option.
