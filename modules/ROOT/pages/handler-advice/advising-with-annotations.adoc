= Advising Endpoints Using Annotations

When configuring certain endpoints by using annotations (`@Filter`, `@ServiceActivator`, `@Splitter`, and `@Transformer`), you can supply a bean name for the advice chain in the `adviceChain` attribute.
In addition, the `@Filter` annotation also has the `discardWithinAdvice` attribute, which can be used to configure the discard behavior, as discussed in <<advising-filters>>.
The following example causes the discard to be performed after the advice:

[source,java]
----
@MessageEndpoint
public class MyAdvisedFilter {

    @Filter(inputChannel="input", outputChannel="output",
            adviceChain="adviceChain", discardWithinAdvice="false")
    public boolean filter(String s) {
        return s.contains("good");
    }
}
