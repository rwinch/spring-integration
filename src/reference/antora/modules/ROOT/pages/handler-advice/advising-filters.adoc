= Advising Filters
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

There is an additional consideration when advising `Filter` advices.
By default, any discard actions (when the filter returns `false`) are performed within the scope of the advice chain.
This could include all the flow downstream of the discard channel.
So, for example, if an element downstream of the discard channel throws an exception and there is a retry advice, the process is retried.
Also, if `throwExceptionOnRejection` is set to `true` (the exception is thrown within the scope of the advice).

Setting `discard-within-advice` to `false` modifies this behavior and the discard (or exception) occurs after the advice chain is called.
